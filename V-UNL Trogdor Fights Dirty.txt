"Trogdor Fights Dirty" (MCharizard & Friends)

Initial Listing (Unlimited Format)

Just to answer the thought of how dirty a mega charizard X deck could really be.

Ninetales accelerates energy. MCharizard brings pain. still some holes to fill in.

TCGPlayer links included because I can't be assed to bother looking for the set names/pictures.
