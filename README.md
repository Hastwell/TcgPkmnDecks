# Hastwell's Pokemon TCG Deck Lists

This repository contains all decks for the Pokemon TCG that I have built, and serves to disseminate my deck lists, and maintain them under a source controlled environment.

## Clarification of NonCommercial Use and Sanctioned Events/Tournaments:
NonCommercial, as defined in Section 1.k, forbids use of the Material or Adapted Material in a manner "primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation". This includes use of the Material in TPCi Sanctioned Events and other tournaments where prizes or compensation of any manner is provided (or could be provided) for use of the Material; you will require a different license for such use, which you may be required to purchase or otherwise compensate the Licensor for such.

If you do obtain a seperate license, the terms of that license will apply to you instead of CC BY-NC-SA for the duration and validity of the seperate license.
