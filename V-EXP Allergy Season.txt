"Allergy Season" (Victreebel/Volcarona/Dragalge)

Initial Listing (Expanded Format)

The original list used dustox. ("Bug Bomb" Deck)
Guardians rising brought up Victreebel which does the same thing with more HP.

Use Victreebel's Pollen Hazard for ridiculous amounts of stacked condition damage between turns.
